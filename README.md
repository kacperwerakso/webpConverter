A small yet highly useful program that streamlines the process of publishing images on websites. Converting images to the .webp format minimizes their size, significantly reducing the load on the website.


1. Create two folders named "ImgToConvert" and "webpReady".
2. Move all images (regardless of their extension) into the "ImgToConvert" folder.
3. Run the program webpConverter.py. Upon completion, all images from the "ImgToConvert" folder will be converted and saved in the .webp format to the "webpReady" folder.
